        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>I was raised by hardworking parents in the small town of Rural Valley, PA, alongside my younger sister. My mother has always had a deep passion for working with individuals with disabilities, and her dedication to helping others has instilled in me a strong sense of empathy and compassion. Her work has taught me the value of kindness and understanding, and I’ve learned the importance of being patient and considerate toward people from all walks of life. My father, an automotive mechanic, has always emphasized the importance of a strong work ethic. Growing up, I watched him tackle every task, whether it was fixing a car or repairing a broken appliance, with confidence and determination. From him, I learned that there’s always a solution if you’re willing to put in the effort.</p>
        <p>Our family has always believed that pets are one of the best parts life. We were lucky enough to have had a beloved chocolate lab named Guss, who sadly passed away in the summer of 2020. A few months later, we welcomed Madex, a silver lab, into our home and he quickly become part of the family. In addition to Madex, we also have two playful ferrets named Violet and Ash. They are a constant source of entertainment with their mischievous antics.</p>

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I completed my high school education at <a href="https://www.lenape.k12.pa.us/">Lenape Technical School</a>, where I graduated from the <a href="https://www.lenape.k12.pa.us/technical-majors/computer-information-technology">Computer Information Technology</a> program. During my time there, I gained a variety of skills, including networking and troubleshooting. I earned three Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) certifications—Networking, Security, and Windows Operating System Fundamentals—though these certifications have since been retired by Microsoft. Additionally, I completed the OSHA 10-hour General Industry Safety and Health program. I was also fortunate to attend SkillUSA's National Leadership and Skills Conference, an experience that helped shape my professional growth.</p>
        <p>My passion for learning made continuing my education beyond high school a natural next step. I am currently a senior at <a href="https://allegheny.edu/">Allegheny College</a>, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in <a href="https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/">Computer Science</a>. In addition to my major, I am double minoring in Psychology and Writing. Allegheny College’s unique combination of majors and minors has provided me with the opportunity to gain a diverse education that takes into account all of my varied interests. My time at Allegheny has been filled with invaluable experiences, both inside and outside the classroom, shaping me into the person I am today—professionally and personally.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>Over the years, I’ve had a diverse range of work experiences that have shaped my skills and provided me with an insight into both technical and interpersonal aspects of work. The day I turned 16, I got my first job at a small, mom-and-pop pizza place in my hometown. When the business switched owners, I stayed on, working there until it eventually shut down. That job taught me the value of customer service, teamwork, and how to manage a fast-paced work environment.</p>
        <p>After graduating high school, I had the opportunity to expand my skills further when I got an internship with Lenape Tech's IT department the summer after graduation. There, I helped prepare the department for the upcoming school year, working on various tasks from troubleshooting to setting up equipment. 
        <p>Once I started college, I returned to <a href="https://www.armstrongsnf.com/about/">Armstrong Rehabilitation and Nursing Center</a> each summer. My first summer there, I worked in housekeeping, ensuring a clean and comfortable environment for the residents. For the remaining summers, I transitioned to the dietary department, where I assisted in meal preparation, taking care to meet the residents’ dietary needs. This experience was incredibly rewarding as it allowed me to interact with the residents directly, strengthening my communication skills and deepening my understanding of the value of providing quality care.
        </p>

        <h1>Hobbies & Interests</h1>
        <p>I have a deep passion for creative expression. Writing fiction allows me to explore new worlds and ideas, while crocheting and knitting give me a hands-on way to relax and create. I’m also an avid reader and enjoy playing video games, always on the lookout for new narratives and challenges.
